###（1）  
Method of complements

In mathematics and computing, the method of complements is a technique used to subtract one number from another using only addition of positive numbers.   
##（2）   
byte
The byte is a unit of digital information that most commonly consists of eight bits, representing a binary number.   
##(3)  
integer  
In computer science, an integer is a datum of integral data type, a data type that represents some range of mathematical integers.  
##(4)   
float-point  
In computing, floating-point arithmetic (FP) is arithmetic using formulaic representation of real numbers as an approximation so as to support a trade-off between range and precision

 NAN  
 In computing, NaN, standing for not a number, is a numeric data type value representing an undefined or unrepresentable value, especially in floating-point calculations. Systematic use of NaNs was introduced by the IEEE 754 floating-point standard in 1985, along with the representation of other non-finite quantities like infinities.

For example, 0/0 is undefined as a real number, and so represented by NaN; the square root of a negative number is imaginary, and thus not representable as a real floating-point number, and so is represented by NaN; and NaNs may be used to represent missing values in computations.[1][2]

Two separate kinds of NaNs are provided, termed quiet NaNs and signaling NaNs. Quiet NaNs are used to propagate errors resulting from invalid operations or values, whereas signaling NaNs can support advanced features such as mixing numerical and symbolic computation or other extensions to basic floating-point arithmetic.
