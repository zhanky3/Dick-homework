5、 # CPU  central processing unit (CPU) is the electronic circuitry within a computer that carries out the instructions of a computer program by performing the basic arithmetic, logic, controlling and input/output (I/O) operations specified by the instructions. The computer industry has used the term "central processing unit" at least since the early 1960s  
RAM  Random-access memory (RAM /ræm/) is a form of computer data storage that stores data and machine code currently being used. A random-access memory device allows data items to be read or written in almost the same amount of time irrespective of the physical location of data inside the memory.  
In computer architecture, a bus[1] (a contraction of the Latin omnibus) is a communication system that transfers data between components inside a computer, or between computers. This expression covers all related hardware components (wire, optical fiber, etc.) and software, including communication protocols.[2]   
Parallel computing is a type of computation in which many calculations or the execution of processes are carried out simultaneously.   

6、云计算是基于互联网的相关服务的增加、使用和交付模式，通常涉及通过互联网来提供动态易扩展且经常是虚拟化的资源。云是网络、互联网的一种比喻说法。过去在图中往往用云来表示电信网，后来也用来表示互联网和底层基础设施的抽象。因此，云计算甚至可以让你体验每秒10万亿次的运算能力，拥有这么强大的计算能力可以模拟核爆炸、预测气候变化和市场发展趋势。用户通过电脑、笔记本、手机等方式接入数据中心，按自己的需求进行运算
